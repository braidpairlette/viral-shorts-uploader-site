<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last updated: February 26, 2026</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes how Viral Shorts Uploader (the “Service”) handles information when used to upload and schedule short-form content to connected social platforms.</p>
<h2>Information We Process</h2>
<p>The Service may process account authorization tokens, basic account profile identifiers, media files selected for upload, captions, tags, and scheduling metadata necessary to perform uploads.</p>
<h2>How Information Is Used</h2>
<p>Information is used only to authenticate with connected platforms, upload content you direct the Service to upload, and maintain posting schedules/state.</p>
<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<p>The Service does not sell personal information. Data is shared only with the social platforms you explicitly connect for the purpose of posting content.</p>
<h2>Data Retention</h2>
<p>Tokens and local scheduling metadata may be stored on the operator’s device or infrastructure for continued use until removed or revoked. You may revoke platform access at any time in the respective platform settings.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Reasonable efforts are used to protect stored credentials and local data, but no method of transmission or storage is guaranteed secure.</p>
<h2>Your Choices</h2>
<p>You may disconnect platform accounts, revoke app permissions, and delete local files or credentials at any time.</p>
<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>For privacy questions, contact the app owner through the associated developer account.</p>
